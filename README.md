# Weather App Project

## This is my "Weather App" project, designed to retrieve current weather information for various locations worldwide. It allows users to quickly and easily obtain up-to-date data on temperature, humidity, wind speed, and other weather conditions.

## Technologies and Libraries

In this project, I utilized the following technologies and libraries:

-   HTML: Used to create the basic structure of the web page.
-   JavaScript: Implemented the functionality of the Weather App, including interaction with the weather API and data processing.
-   Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building modern websites without ever leaving HTML
-   Next.js: enables to create high-quality web applications with the power of React components.
-   React: Is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on components.
-   OpenWeatherMap API: Integrated to retrieve real-time weather data. To use it, you need to obtain an API key from the OpenWeatherMap website and include it in the project.
-   GeoDB: An online places database. It exposes city, county, island, region, and country data via both GraphQL and REST APIs
-   Moment.js Library: Utilized for working with dates and times, particularly for date formatting.
-   tsParticles: A lightweight TypeScript library for creating particles(animation).

## Instructions

-   Clone the repository or download it as a ZIP archive.
-   Obtain an API key from the OpenWeatherMap website and save it.
-   In the apiconstants.ts file, find the WEATHER_API_KEY variable and replace its value with your obtained API key.
-   Run the "npm run dev" command in your terminal for developing localHost.

## Further Enhancements

In the future, you can expand the functionality of the "Weather App" project by adding the following features:

-   Additional weather parameters such as UV index, precipitation levels, etc.
-   Visualization of weather data using charts or diagrams.
